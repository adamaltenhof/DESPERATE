# DEnoising SPEctRA in pyThon with wavElets (DESPERATE)

DESPERATE is a Python library for processing and denoising NMR spectra


## Requirements
- All testing has been done with Python 3.10 and newer
- NumPy
- SciPy
- matplotlib
- PyWavelets
- nmrglue (mainly optional)

## Installation
- pip #

## Features
- functions.py contains some processing functions for Topspin data including loading FID's or SER's, FFT, window functions, phasing, automatic phasing, a manual phasing widget, Cadzow denoising, and PCA denoising
- wavelet_denoise.py contains all wavelet denoising functions; wavelet_denoise and wavelet_denoise2 are for 1D and 2D spectra, respectively
